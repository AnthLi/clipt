# Clipt (WIP)

Working on a research paper where you copied some information to use, but
accidentally copied over it with the URL of a funny post on Reddit?

With Clipt, whatever you copy will be stored and can be used at a later
time. Never again will you have to worry about copying over something
important!

## Features
- Displays clips in descending order (latest to earliest) so the most recent
  clips appear at the top, and the oldest ones at the bottom
- Clips can be deleted on demand
- Supports copying of: text, images

## Development

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://goo.gl/QXkkAl)
- [Electron](https://goo.gl/3gzXUm)

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
